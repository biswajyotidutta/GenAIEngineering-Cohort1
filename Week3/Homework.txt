@everyone Here is the homework:
Homework Assignment: Build a Streamlit App for Simplifying Complex Tech Topics

Objective:
Develop a Streamlit application that assists users in breaking down and explaining complex tech topics in simple terms. Your app should include:
1. Guardrails: Ensure safe and appropriate use.
2. System Prompts: Guide the assistantâ€™s tone and behaviour.
3. Tool Calling: Enable dynamic features (e.g., web search, summarisation).
4. Evaluations: Assess the clarity and accuracy of explanations.

What You'll Learn & Practice:
1. Implementing AI-driven UX in a real-world app.
2. Designing with user-centric prompt engineering.
3. Integrating guardrails and evaluation mechanisms for reliability.
4. Using Streamlit to build and deploy interactive AI tools.

Why This Matters:
This project helps you build foundational skills in AI product development and prompt design. You'll also gain hands-on experience with user safety and evaluation, which are key components in any modern AI application.

Optional:
Feel free to add any features, such as user feedback collection, topic history, or interactive quizzes. Be creative and consider real user needs!
